## My process

This was my first attempt at my own html/CSS layout. To improve my baseline understanding of basic html and CSS, I wanted to try to code the solution without frameworks. As I got into the project, I reached a point where I had to force solutions with some overly-involved CSS that I should work to clean up for the next project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- CSS flexbox layout
- Better understanding of the Box model
- Difference between .svg and other image formats

### Continued development

- Cleaner CSS styling
- Additional styling with hover states.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://codepip.com/games/flexbox-froggy/) - This game QUICKLY got me a working understanding of flexbox.
